1.  List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
      adding - INSERT INTO
      updating - UPDATE
      deleting - DELETE FROM

2.  Explain the structure for each type of command.
      - INSERT INTO is followed by the table name which is followed by the VALUES.
      - UPDATE is followed by the table name which is followed by a / multiple SET clause/s, which may
        be followed by a WHERE clause.
      - DELETE FROM is followed by the table name then a WHERE clause which may be followed by an AND clause.


3.  What are some fo the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real world example of each.
      - money: ATM balance
      - text: An online retailer's description of an item
      - date: An expiration date

4.  Think through how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding.
    This table needs to have first and last name whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests
    they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

      - Which data type would you used to store each of the following pieces of information:
        - First and last name :text
        - whether they send in their RSVP :boolean
        - number of guests :integer
        - number of meals :float
      - Write a command that makes the table to track the wedding.
        CREATE TABLE wedding (
          name text,
          rsvp boolean,
          number_of_guests integer,
          number_of_meals float
        );

      - Using the table we just created, write a command that adds a column to track whether they were
        sent a thank you card.
          ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thank_you_card boolean;

      - You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove
        the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
          ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN number_of_meals;

      - The guests are going to need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column
        for table number.
          ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table_number integer;

      - The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the
        wedding table from the database.
          DROP TABLE wedding;

5. Write a command to make a new table to hold the books in a library with columns ISBN, title, author, genre,
    publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

      CREATE TABLE books (
      isbn numeric(13,0)
      title text,
      author text,
      genre text,
      publishing_date date,
      number_of_copies integer,
      available_copies integer
      );

      -Find three books and add their information to the table.
        INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, author, genre, publishing_date, number_of_copies, available_copies) VALUES
        (9781338109061, "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay", "J.K. Rowling",
        "Young Adult Fantasy", "November 2016", 1, 1),
        (9780307588364, "Gone Girl", "Gillian Flynn", "Fiction - Mystery & Detective", "June 2012", 1, 1),
        (9780446585026, "Seriously...I'm Kidding", "Ellen Degeneres", "Autobiography", "October 2011", 1, 1);

      -Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the available copies column to 1 fewer.
        UPDATE books SET available_copies = 0 WHERE title = "Gone Girl";

      -Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
        DELETE FROM books WHERE title = "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay";

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched,
    country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and
    approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following
    operations:

      CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
        id integer,
        name text,
        year_launched integer,
        country_of_origin text,
        description_of_mission text,
        orbiting_body text,
        currently_operating boolean,
        miles_from_Earth integer
      );
      - Add 3 non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table
        INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, year_launched, country_of_origin, description_of_mission,
          orbiting_body, currently_operating, miles_from_Earth) VALUES
          (1, "Zeus", 1980, "Japan", "take photos of Mars", "Mars", true, 34000000),
          (2, "Optimus 1.0", 1990, "United States", "get geological samples of Earth's moon", "Moon", , 238900),
          (3, "Searcher", 1978, "Australia", "get pictures of Saturn", "Saturn", true, 1000000000);

      - Remove one the satellites from the table since it has just been crashed to the planet
        DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id = 3;

      - Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that
        UPDATE spacecrafts SET currently_operating = false WHERE id = 1;

7. Write a command to make a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject
    line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not it’s been read,
    and the id of the email chain it’s in.
    Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

    CREATE TABLE emails (
      id integer,
      subject text,
      sender text,
      recipients text,
      body text,
      timestamp timestamp,
      read boolean,
      email_chain_id integer
    );

      - Add 3 new emails to the inbox
        INSERT INTO emails (id, subject, sender, recipients, body, timestamp, read, email_chain_id) VALUES
        (1,"How's It Going?", "Dad", "me@google.com", "Haven't heard from you lately. Call me.",
        TIMESTAMP '2018-06-14 18:17:00', false, 1),
        (2,"How to Increase Your Profits", "Joe Money", "me@google.com", "Click this link to hear more"
        TIMESTAMP '2018-06-14 18:17:00', false, 2),
        (3,"BOGO 50% SHOES!", "Forever 21", "me@google.com", "Need more shoes? BOGO 50% currently going on."
        TIMESTAMP '2018-06-14 18:17:00', false, 3);

      - You've just deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
        DELETE FROM emails WHERE id = 2;

      - You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before
        investigating, so you can come back to it later.
        UPDATE emails SET read = false WHERE id = 1;
