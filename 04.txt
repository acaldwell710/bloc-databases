1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
  SELECT something FROM table WHERE condition;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement,
such as a mnemonic.

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

  -Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
    SELECT name, gender, age FROM dogs WHERE breed = '%labrador%';

  -Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
    SELECT id FROM dogs WHERE age < 1;

  -Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
    SELECT name, age FROM dogs WHERE gender = 'F' AND weight > 35;

  -Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
    SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE breed != '%shepherd%';

  -Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
    SELECT id, age, weight, breed FROM dogs WHERE weight > 60 OR breed = 'great dane';

    Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple
    words (for example, "Labrador Collie Mix").

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

  -SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
      'Mushi', '2016-03-22'
      'Seashell', NULL
      'Azul', '2016-04-17'
      'Victoire', '2016-09-01'
      'Nala', NULL

  -SELECT name, age FROM cats;
      'Mushi', 1
      'Seashell', 7
      'Azul', 3
      'Victoire', 7
      'Nala', 1

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

  -Display all the information about all of the available cats.
    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE adoption_date = NULL;

  -Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
    SELECT name, gender FROM cats WHERE age = 7;

  -Find all of the names of the cats, so you don't choose duplicate names for new cats.
    SELECT name FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain, in your own words, when you would use it. Include a real
world example for each.
  > : greater than - 1/3 of a pie is greater than 1/4 of a pie.
  < : less than - 1/2 of a pie is less than a whole pie.
  = : equal to - "Amber" is equal to "Amber".
  >= : greater than or equal to - 50 >= 50
  <= : less than or equal to - 40 <= 41
  != : not equal to - "Their" is not equal to "They're"
  <> : not equal to -

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
  -SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = "F";
    'Seashell'
    'Nala'

  -SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
    'Mushi'
    'Seashell'
    'Victoire'
    'Nala'

  -SELECT id FROM cats WHERE name != "Mushi" AND gender = "M";
